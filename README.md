# ðŸ–¥ Introduction

My name is Nico Marcelino (Helixneek). I am a dedicated game programmer and machine learning engineer with 1-2 years of experience, I am passionate about crafting immersive and entertaining gaming experiences. Utilized industry-standard programming languages and tools such as C, C#, C++, Unity, and Unreal Engine to create engaging gameplay experiences. I have also used tools like Tensorflow and Keras to design and implement deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to solve complex problems in computer vision and natural language processing. With this, I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills to drive excellence in game development.

To complement my game development, I have also taken up learning 2D art, specifically pixel art. I also have started learning how to compose video game soundtrack.
