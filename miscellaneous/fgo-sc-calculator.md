# FGO SC Calculator

**FGO SC** (Fate/Grand Order Servant Coin) Calculator is a helper website for the mobile game Fate/Grand Order. This lets you check the amount of Servant Coins you have based on which Servant, their bond level and their NP level.

I made this in Javascript with extra help from JQuery.
