# Rogue Resurgence (2023)

**Rogue Resurgence** is a 2D platformer where you play as a brave robot armed with a powerful rocket launcher. The goal is simple: navigate a difficult obstacle course by using the rocket launcher's explosive thrust to propel yourself across wide gaps, over hazards, and past various obstacles. Currently, this game is only a demo.

This game features:

* **Rocket-Powered Propulsion:** Unlike traditional platformers, where jumping is the primary means of movement, Rogue Resurgence relies entirely on rocket-powered propulsion. Players must carefully time and aim their rocket blasts to move in any direction.&#x20;
* **Physics-Based Challenges:** The movement and behavior of the rocket-powered robot are governed by realistic physics.
* **Progressive Difficulty:** The game features a gradually increasing difficulty curve, allowing players to steadily improve their rocket riding skills.
