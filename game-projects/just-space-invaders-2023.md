**Just Space Invaders** is a recreation (or clone) of Space Invaders for the Atari 2600. This game only has the basic gameplay aspect of Space Invaders, without the score. It's either they die or you die, very simple. There is also no sound since there is no sound in space.

{% hint style="info" %}
This game was made for my college assignment. It was made with C# in the Unity Engine. I recreated the sprites from the original game.
