# Cosmic Clash (2024)

**Cosmic Clash** is a 2D top-down shooter where you pilot a spaceship and shoot down other spaceships. The goal is to obtain the most coins. These coins can either be obtained by picking them up from the ground, or defeating other players and picking up their coins. This game is only for internal use within **PT Freeport Indonesia.**
