This game covers several parts of the job finding process:

*   **Linkedin:** Players will build a mock Linkedin page to simulate the process of creating a real one. They will create and design each part of the page to form one complete Linkedin page. Each part has their own unique minigame which has to be completed. The parts of the page that are made include:

    * Header
    * About section
    * Featured works
    * Education
    * Skills
    * Languages
    * Recommendations by others
