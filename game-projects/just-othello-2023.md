**Just Othello** is a simplified recreation of the board game Othello. Like the actual Othello game, each player places one piece to change the other pieces in a cardinal and diagonal direction. A piece can only be placed if there is another piece of the same color in a diagonal or cardinal direction, "flanking" or surrounding your opponent's color. The winner is the player with the most amount of pieces on the board at the end of the game.
