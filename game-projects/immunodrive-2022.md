**Immunodrive** is a medical themed shoot'em-up game with roguelike elements. In this game, the player is a human immune cell that is fighting an infection inside the body. Unlike other immune cells, the player is a cell that could mutate rapidly, gain more power and change themself to suit their needs.

This game features:

* **Roguelike Upgrade System**: After defeating a boss or mini-boss, the player will be able to choose an upgrade from a randomized set of choices. Each upgrade is unique and increases a certain component of the character, such as their damage, health, rate of fire or even number of projectiles shot.
* **Randomly Chosen Areas**: Not every journey will be the same. The player will go to a random area after an area's completion. Each area has their own set of enemies, wave configurations and bosses.
* **Progressive Difficulty:** The game features a gradually increasing difficulty curve, allowing players to steadily improve their skills. Immunodrive keeps the action and challenge levels high with a gradually rising difficulty level.
* **Medical Education**: Immunodrive prominently utilizes pathology and medicine in its presentation. Whether its from the enemies, the areas, and the upgrades, the game uses real-life knowledge to build an educational experience.
