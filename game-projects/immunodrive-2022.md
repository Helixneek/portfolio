**Immunodrive** is a medical themed shoot'em-up game with roguelike elements. In this game, the player is a human immune cell that is fighting an infection inside the body. Unlike other immune cells, the player is a cell that could mutate rapidly, gain more power and change themself to suit their needs.

The player will fight microorganisms like bacteria and viruses by shooting proteins at them. These proteins will destroy any pathogen that comes into contact with it. After every battle, the player will be able to mutate and gain upgrades to keep up with the constantly mutating enemies. These upgrades include increased defenses, increase attack and other unique changes.

The infection has affected multiple areas of the body, so the player has to traverse them to clean them out. Each area has multiple waves, with a mini boss and a boss. After defeating the mini boss or boss of the area, the player can choose an upgrade. The choices are randomly chosen every time. The final area will also have a final boss. It is a stronger version of a regular boss. After their defeat, the game will end in the player's victory.
