# Are You Smarter than a Fetus? (2023)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/itch ss1.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Main menu screen</p></figcaption></figure>

**Are You Smarter than a Fetus?** is a quiz and word puzzle game with two distinct modes:

1. **Trivia Mode**: Players are presented with a series of multiple-choice questions covering a wide range of topics. The questions are drawn from a database and can be randomized to ensure variety. Players have a limited time to provide their answers. Scoring is based on the number of correct answers.
2. **Hangman Mode**: Players are given a hidden word represented by blanks, and they must guess individual letters to uncover the word. Players have a limited number of incorrect guesses (typically represented by a hangman figure). The words can be sourced from a predefined list or generated from a database, ensuring a diverse word pool.

Technical features of the game may include a user interface, database management for questions and words and timer mechanisms. Additionally, the game can be designed for various platforms, including mobile devices, desktop computers, and web browsers, and may be built to have multiplayer options or leaderboards to promote competition among players.
